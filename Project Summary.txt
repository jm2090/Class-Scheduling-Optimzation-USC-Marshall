•	Hired by USC Marshall to investigate the possibility of applying optimization to improve the efficiency 
        and transparency of the current manual method of assigning classes 
•	Identified 3 major pain points including time - consuming scheduling methodology, inappropriate utilization of
        classroom space and professors’ preferences not being satisfied
•	Delivered an optimization tool prototype that intakes the readily available slots, classrooms and class 
        information, and outputs the schedule for all classes and a summary of schedule performance using Gurobi
